      <p> WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
<br>
    This course is the first of a series that will enable you to become an effective leader and advocate, both within and outside your organization, on issues related to diversity, equity and inclusion. In this course, you’ll explore how to engage members of your organization in important and challenging conversations. You’ll learn by playing games (realistic simulations) in which animated characters challenge you to understand their perspectives and interests.
<br>
The simulations cover a wide range of situations in which issues of diversity, equity and inclusion may arise. Complementing compliance training, this course offers a safe space to practice difficult conversations and explore diverging viewpoints. By the end of this course, you’ll be able to: • Engage others in important conversations about issues related to diversity, equity and inclusion • Understand the perspectives of others and find common ground• Manage conflicts that arise among team members • Facilitate collaboration among diverse team members • Make decisions that meet organizational objectives and satisfy people’s interests

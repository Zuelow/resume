      <p> WHAT YOU WILL LEARN

    et a rock-solid foundation for your network, users, and data by learning about the basics of cybersecurity. Security expert Malcolm Shore describes how to assess and mitigate risks using various 
cybersecurity frameworks and control standards, such as NIST, COBIT 5, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Malcolm details pertinent cyber threats and how they operate, including 
how cyber criminals hide their attacks, how advanced persistent threats (APTs) work, and even how to determine what’s real and what’s merely cyber fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). 
Throughout the course, he also covers managing cyber risk; selecting and applying controls; and the overall cybersecurity lifecycle, from managing defense to responding to cybersecurity incidents 
when they occur.
